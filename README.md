# Movie Database
The user will be able to search for their favorite TV series or movie if available on the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). Users will also be able to add/remove selections to their Favorites page. They will be able to view their Favorites list by clicking on the Favorites button. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technologies
- Next.js
- React.js

These technologies were chosen to get more practice Next.js as it provides a better structure and framework to React.js that (defunct) 
`create-next-app` did not provide. Working with these technologies required learning new ways of handling CSS and elements such as images. It also required delving into new issues that I had not come across using Next.js.
